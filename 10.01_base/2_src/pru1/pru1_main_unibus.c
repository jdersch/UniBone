 28-mar-2019  JH      split off from "all-function" main
 12-nov-2018  JH      entered beta phase

 Master and slave functionality for UNIBUS devices.
 Assumes a physical PDP-11 CPU is working as Arbitrator for
 NPR/NG/SACK and BR/BG/SACK.
 Needed if UniBone runs in a system running PDP-11 CPU
 and simulated or physical devices do DMA or INTR.

 Separated from "all-function" main() because of PRU code size limits.
 Application has to load this into PRU1 depending on system state.

 Test GPIO, shared mem and interrupt
 a) waits until ARM writes a value to mailbox.arm2pru_req
 b) ACKs with clear of arm2pru_req
 c) toggles 1 mio times GPIO, with delay as set by ARM
 d) signal EVENT0
 e) goto a

 3 major states executed in circular 1- 2- 3 order.

 1. "SLAVE":
 UniBone monitoring BUS traffic as slave for DATI/DATO cycles
 Watch UNIBUS for CPU access to emulated memory/devices
 High speed not necessary: Bus master will wait with MSYN if UniBone not responding.
 wathcin BG/BPG signals, catching requested GRANts and forwardinf
 other GRANTS
 - monitoring INIT and AC_LO/DC_LO
 - watching fpr AMR2PRU commands
 2. "BBSYWAIT": UNibone got PRIORITY GRAMT, has set SACK and released BR/NPR
 waits for current BUS master to relaeasy BBSY (ony DATI/DATO cycle max)
 - SACK active: no GRANT forward necessary, no arbitration necessary
 - INIT is monitored by DMA statemachine: no DC_LO/INIT monitoring necessary
 3. "MASTER": UniBone is Bus master: transfering INTR vector or doing DMA
 - Own timing: transfer DMA data block or INTR vector with master cycles
 - SACK active: no GRANT forward necessary, no arbitration necessary
 - INIT is monitored by DMA statemachine: no DC_LO/INIT monitoring necessary
