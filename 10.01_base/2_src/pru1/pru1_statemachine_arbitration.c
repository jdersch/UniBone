 12-nov-2018  JH      entered beta phase

 Statemachine for execution of the Priority Arbitration protocol
 NPR arbitration and BR interrupt arbitration

 PRU handles all 5 requests in parallel:
 4x INTR BR4-BR7
 1x DMA NPR.
 Several ARM device may raise the same BR|NPR level, ARM must serialize this to PRU.

 Flow:
 1. ARM sets a REQUEST by
 filling the RQUEST struct and perhaps DMA data
 doing AMR2PRO_PRIORITY_ARBITRATION_REQUEST,
 2. PRU sets BR4567|NPR lines according to open requests
 3. PRU monitors IN GRANT lines BG4567,NPG.
 IN state of idle requests is forwarded to BG|NPG OUT liens,
 to be processed by other UNIBUS cards.
 BG*|NPG IN state line of active request cleares BR*|NPR line,
 sets SACK, and starts INTR or DMA state machine.
 4. INTR or DMA sent a signal on compelte to PRU.
 PRU may then start next request on same (completed) BR*|NPR level.

 All references "PDP11BUS handbook 1979"
 - At any time, CPU receives NPR it asserts NPG
 - between CPU instructions:
 if PRI < n and BRn is received, assert BGn
 else if PRI < 7 and BR7 is reived, assert BG7
 else if PRI < 6 and BR6 is reived, assert BG6
 else if PRI < 5 and BR5 is reived, assert BG5
 else if PRI < 4 and BR4 is reived, assert BG4


 If PRU detectes a BGINn which it not requested, it passes it to BGOUTn
 "passing the grant"
 if PRU detects BGIN which was requests, it "blocks the GRANT" )sets SACK and
 transmit the INT (BG*) or becomes
 "no interrupt request while NPR transfer active!"
 Meaning: bus mastership acquired by NPG may not be used to transmit an
 INTR vector.

 Device may take bus if BBSY==0 && SSYN==0 && NPG==0
 Device timing: assert NPR, wait for NPG, assert SACK, wait for NPG==0, set SACK=0 ,

 BBSY is set before SACK is released. SACK is relased imemdiatley after BBSY,
 enabling next arbitration in parallel to curretn data transfer
 "Only the device with helds SACk asserted can assert BBSY


 Several arbitration "workers" which set request, monitor or generate GRANT signals
 and allocate SACK.
 Which worker to use depends on wether a physical PDP-11 CPU is Arbitrator,
 the Arbitrator is implmented here (CPU emulation),
 or DMA should be possible always
 (even if some other CPU monitr is holding SACK (11/34).
